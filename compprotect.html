<h2>How can computer science contribute to stop the COVID-19 pandemic?</h2>
      <h3>
  <li>The question of how computers can contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being posed to experts in artificial intelligence (AI) all over the world.</li>
  <li>AI tools can help in many different ways. They are being used to predict the spread of the coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis, and in the development of potential treatments, while also helping policymakers cope with related issues, such as the impact on transport, food supplies and travel.</li>
  <li>But in all these cases, AI is only effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from. As COVID-19 has taken the world into unchartered territory, the "deep learning" systems, which computers use to acquire new capabilities, don’t necessarily have the data they need to produce useful outputs.</li>
  <li>The use of pattern recognition techniques can be helpful for localization the existing of the cells of the virus in the body for example Russia uses facial recognition to tackle Covid-19. City officials are using a giant network of tens of thousands of cameras - installed with facial recognition software. An interesting New York Times article last week posited that governments’ use of digital surveillance techniques for the COVID-19 response – such as the tracking of geolocation to gauge quarantine restrictions – would lead to more pervasive digital tracking in the future. On a related note, there have been reports of an increased use of facial recognition technologies as governments use digital tools to respond to the outbreak.</li>
  <li>Al can helps to recognize the location of existing ceels of the virus covid 19 on the humans body by facial recognition technologies and can neural netwok also may be avoid or attempt to learn the netwok the available treatment and to avoid increesed the cells of covid_19 on the humman's boody.</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing Parser can help in the development of interactive chat bot that can give preventive measures, symptoms, FAQs of Covid-19, Emergency contacts for all the districts, provinces or states and general toll-free number of ministry of health, live information on cases of Covid-19 patient(s), infection rate(s) and many more.</li>
  <li>computer science can build many applications that could warn people from this virus!</li>
